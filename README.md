# Spreadsheet

1- The Java classes corresponding to the domain model.

2- The code needed to implement the load spreadsheet and save spreadsheet use cases as well as the minimum operations to be able to test them, i.e you should be able to set and view the content (not the value) of the cells.

Take into account that for the second point you don't need to evaluate formulas nor calculate anything, only be able to manipulate the content of the cells.

Please upload your implementation to github and upload a text file with its URL to Atenea.
